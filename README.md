# Autonomous-Navigation-beamNG-MATLAB

### here's the big idea

* create digital twin of offrad capable vehicle
* use beamNG for demonstration and MATLAB for backend and sensor visualization
* integrate AI + ML
* create a video

### the tools I'll need

* [beamNG - MATLAB / simulink integration dependencies](https://documentation.beamng.com/beamng_tech/matlab_and_simulink/)
  * beamNG.tech, beamNG.py, beamNG-MATLABL-simulink-integration, MATLAB, Python
* [naivgation toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/nav/index.html)
* [sensor fusion and tracking toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/fusion/index.html)
* [robotics system toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/index.html)

### resources

* mathworks videos and webinars series ([Autonomous Navigation](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/autonomous-navigation.html))
  * 6 part series
  * take notes that are in scope - should have an easy video by the end
  * going to have to work off the beaten path when integrating with beamNG (we'll see)

 ### topics

 * localization, pose estimation, sensor fusion, partical filters, motion planning, mapping, algorithms
